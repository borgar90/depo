# README

This README documents the work Borgar Flaen Stensrud did at the start of his intership @ Rubynor in Skien, Norway. Borgar woked his way trough
the book "agile web development with rails 7", creating a "Pragmatic Bookshelf webstore" in rails. 

I was new to Rails and Ruby at the beginning of this internship, but I learned quickly.

* Ruby version: 3.1.3
* System dependencies: Browserscript with modern css/js
* Configuration
* Database creation
* Database initialization
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions

Captains log: 

* Early start:

   I have worked with learning the basics of rails. Set up the store and scaffolded several controllers/models/views. Put up a storefront and added products

* week 1:

  Worked with implementing carts/orders/users/I18n. The most exciting part was the hotwiring of the storefront.
  I have long experience with Ajax and web sockets in later years, it was nice to see how efficiently one could use stimulus in comparison.
  I finished most of the development parts of the book in week 1 and will start work on deployment in week 2.
